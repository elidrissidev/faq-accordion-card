### What I learned

I learned in this challenge about the `details` and `summary` elements that can be used to build an accordion, it was funny because I stumbled accross them only after building the entire thing with javascript :D, but still better late than never.

### Continued development

Positioning the image in both desktop and mobile was the most difficult part of this challenge for me. I was confused at first if I should be using a background image on a `div`, an `img`, or `::before` pseudo-class which is what I ended up using. Hopefully in the next challenges It will get easier as I get to practice it more.

### Useful resources

- [\<details\>: The Details disclosure element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) - This helped me to know how to use `details` and `summary` HTML elements to create an accordion.
